## What is Version control system?

**VCS** is a software tool that tracks and manages changes to a set of files over time. VCS is also known as source control or revision control.

### VCS helps software teams

- **Collaborate**: Regularly merging code changes into a central repository, followed by automated builds and tests.
- **Reduce development time**: Ensuring that code changes are automatically prepared for a release to production.
- **Protect source code**: Managing and provisioning computing infrastructure through machine-readable scripts.
- **Roll back changes**: Continuously monitoring applications and infrastructure to identify and resolve issues quickly.
- **Consolidate changes**: VCS allows developers to consolidate changes from multiple developers into a single version.

### Here's how VCS works

-	**Takes snapshots**: As a developer edits code, VCS takes a snapshot of the files and saves it permanently. 
-	**Stores in a repository**: VCS stores all file versions in a centralized database, or repository, on a server. 
-	**Checks out the latest version**: Users check out the latest version from the server. 
-	**Resolves conflicts**: Contributors push commits to the server and resolve merge conflicts on the repository. 

### Types of Version Control Systems: 
-	Local Version Control Systems
-	Centralized Version Control Systems
-	Distributed Version Control Systems

## Local version control system :
All project data is stored on a single computer, and changes made to project files are stored as patches. This is the simplest form of version control and is primarily used by solo developers. 
## Centralized VCS: 
Stores all project files in a single central repository. Developers check out files from the central repository to make changes, and commit those changes back to the same location. 
## Distributed VCS: 
Stores project files across multiple repositories, with each developer having a local copy of the project's full history on their computer.

## What is git?
Git is a free, open-source version control system (VCS) that tracks changes to projects: 
-	**Stores code:** Git stores source code and its development history in a local repository. 
-	**Tracks changes:** Git tracks revision history and allows users to revert to earlier code versions. 
-	**Merges code:** Git allows users to merge code changes. 
-	**Branches:** Git supports branching, which allows users to create new projects from existing source code. 
-	**Rewrites history:** Git allows users to rewrite repository history. 
-	**Pull requests:** Git supports pull requests, which allow teams to collaborate on branches and review each other's code

**Here are some features of Git:**
-	**Distributed:** Each developer has a local clone of the project's history, which allows them to work offline or remotely. 
-	**Performance:** Git is designed for performance, with fast commit, branch, merge, and compare operations. 
-	**Support:** Git is supported by nearly every development environment and major operating system. 
-	**User community:** Git has a large user community with resources for training and help.
